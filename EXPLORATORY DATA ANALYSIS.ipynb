    "# The National Survey of Family Growth\n",
    "Since 1973, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have conducted the *National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)*, which is intended to gather “information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health. The survey results are used...to plan health services and health education programs, and to do statistical studies of families, fertility, and health.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use data collected by this survey to investigate whether first babies tend to come late, as well as answer other questions. In order to use this data effectively, we have to understand the design of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSFG is a **cross-sectional study**, which means that it captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time. The most common alternative is a **longitudinal study**, which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSFG has been conducted seven times; each deployment is called a **cycle**. We will use data from Cycle 6, which was conducted from January 2002 to March 2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the survey is to draw conclusions about a **population**; the target population of the NSFG is people in the United States aged 15-44. Ideally surveys would collect data from every member of the population, but that’s seldom possible. Instead we collect data from a subset of the population called a **sample**. The people who participate in a\n",
    "survey are called **respondents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, cross-sectional studies are meant to be **representative**, which means that every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating. That ideal is hard to achieve in practice, but people who conduct surveys come as close as they can.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NSFG is not representative; instead it is deliberately **oversampled**. The designers of the study recruited three groups—Hispanics, African Americans and teenagers—at rates higher than their representation in the U.S. population, in order to make sure that the number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw valid statistical inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the drawback of oversampling is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general population based on statistics from the survey. We will come back to this point later.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with this kind of data, it is important to be familiar with the *codebook*, which documents the design of the study, the survey questions, and the encoding of the responses. The codebook and user’s guide for the NSFG data are available from the [CDC’s website](http://1.usa.gov/1pi2BP2)."
